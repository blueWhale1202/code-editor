# 🚀 Code Editor Project

## 📌 Overview
The **Code Editor** project is designed to provide a seamless and powerful coding experience directly in the browser. It supports multiple programming languages, offers rich development features, and ensures efficient execution with a scalable backend.

## 🎯 Challenges & Solutions

### **Challenges**
- Direct execution of compiled languages (C++, C#, Java, etc.) in the browser is not feasible due to runtime dependencies.
  
### **Solutions**
- **Docker Engine**: Utilizes pre-configured containers to run executable code, collect results, and remove containers after execution.
- **Piston Engine**: Acts as a dispatcher to determine runtime environments and optimize resource allocation, reducing the need for manual Docker configurations.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 📝 **Advanced Code Editing**
- **Code Completion**: Helps in writing code efficiently with intelligent suggestions.
- **Parameter Info**: Displays function/method parameter hints.
- **Quick Info**: Shows detailed descriptions of functions, variables, and objects.
- **Member Lists**: Autocompletes object properties and methods.

### 🚀 **Powerful Execution & Debugging**
- **Syntax Error Detection**: Provides real-time syntax error highlighting.
- **Code Formatting**: Automatically formats code for better readability.
- **Multi-language Support**:
  - **Compiled Languages**: C++, C#, Java.
  - **Interpreted Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python.
- **Execution Output**:
